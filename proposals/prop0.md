# Proposal Process

Anyone can make suggestions to include on the infrastructure documentation.
After an initial discussion between the relevant parties the infrastructure 
team will assign the writing and management of the proposal to a lead.
During a period to be determined by the infrastructure team changes are to
be suggested via GitHub tickets o this repository.
After this discussion period the proposal can be accepted and added to
the infrastructure documentation or refused.
Once a proposal is added to the documentation it's the infrastructure's team
task to make it happen.
