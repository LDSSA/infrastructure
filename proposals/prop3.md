# Infrastructure Proposal

## Portal
TBD
* Change from Laravel to Django CMS(?) if no one is comfortable with PHP
* Share DB with grader and directly call the grader on assignments
* Leaderboard/hackathons

## Grader
TBD
* Strip down NbGrader to run grading only (?)
* Run assignments specific env
* Deal with updates


## GitHub
TBD
* Reduce manual steps for release
* Infra + Instructors still need to review stuff before release
* Bugfix release needs to be streamlined
* Use GitHub hooks (?)
